;; to def and get an object from the scene
(defmacro defgetter
  "(defgetter name 0-ary-body? 1-ary-body?)

  def form for defining GameObject getter functions that reach into the Unity scene graph.

  Establishes and maintains a live, serializable correspondence between the var named by `name` and an individual GameObject, and binds this var to a 0-ary getter function instance that will always return the currently-corresponding GameObject. 

  The syntax is close to that of a defn, with bodies of 0 or 1 arguments supported:

  (defgetter the-floor
    ([]
     (let [floor (arcadia.core/create-primitive :cube)]
       (set! (.name floor) \"the-floor\")
       floor))
    ([floor]
     (arcadia.core/with-cmpt floor [tr Transform]
       (set! (.position tr) (v3 0 -0.5 0))
       (set! (.localScale tr) (v3 1000 1 100)))))

  Both arities only run when the `defgetter` form itself is evaluated (they are not the body of the produced getter function).

  The 0-ary body is useful for constructing GameObject, the 1-ary body is body is useful for mutating existing GameObjects or changing the association to a different GameObject.

  0-ary-body:
  ([] exprs*)

  The 0-ary body, if supplied, runs only if the var bound by this def form (#'car, in the example above) is currently not associated with a live GameObject, and should return a GameObject (an error is thrown if it does not). The var will then be associated with the returned GameObject. This arity can be used to create a new GameObject, or to find one already in the scene.

  1-ary-body:
  ([obj] exprs*)

  The 1-ary body, if supplied, runs whenever the `defgetter` form is evaluated (just after the 0-ary body, if it is present). `obj` is the GameObject currently associated with the var, or `nil` if no such var exists.

  If the 1-ary body returns a GameObject, the var will be associated with that GameObject. If it does not, or if an error is thrown in `exprs*`, the var will remain associated with `obj`.

  After `defgetter` is evaluated, the var `name` will be bound to a getter function that will return the GameObject associated with `name`, or `nil` if no such GameObject exists. If the GameObject associatd with `name` changes, the getter function will subsequently return that new GameObject."
